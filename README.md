# Introduction: CS onstitution

### What is the CS Constitution?

The CS Constitution documents the core rules, structure, and processes of the Holacracy-based “operating system” for governing and managing used by us. It provides the foundation for us to use and adapt Holacracy, by anchoring the shift of power required in concrete and documented “rules of the game”, which everyone involved can rely upon.

### How is the CS Constitution intended to be used?
The Constitution is intended to be referenced by whatever declaration or agreement captures the decision to organize using this Holacracy-based system. That may be a formal set of legal bylaws or similar operating agreement, or a simple board resolution or CEO policy declaration similar to the <a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/blob/master/Adoption%20Declaration.md" target="_blank">sample one attached here</a>. See Article V for key adoption-related matters. Also note that this explanatory page and the sample declaration are included for informative purposes but are not part of the core Constitution document.

### What the CS Constitution isn’t
The CS Constitution is not a methodology or anything like it. It is our own set of operating rules based on and derrived from original Holacracy by HolacracyOne.
